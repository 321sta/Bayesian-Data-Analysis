# Bayesian-Data-Analysis
The project consists of two main parts. The first part uses INLA to perform Bayesian linear regression and robust regression on Edinburghâ€™s monthly rainfall data, including model diagnostics, residual analysis, and posterior predictive checks. The second part applies JAGS to perform clustering on South American frog call data, fitting bivariate normal and mixture models, along with convergence diagnostics and model evaluation. The complete R Markdown code and its corresponding PDF report demonstrate all analysis steps and results.
